= Coffee Book

A book for people that turn coffee into code. It's meant for user-need developers that want to look up things, find tidbits and links to further reading/hearing/watching material.

So far I have collected lots of interesting material but all in private, not visible to anyone but myself. I am sure many of you have done the same. That seems wasteful. I would like to change that.

For the english version please link:en/Intro.adoc[start here].
