=== Block Quotes and "`Smart`" Ones

____
AsciiDoc is _so_ *powerful*!
____

This verse comes to mind.

[verse]
La la la

Here's another quote:

[quote, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]
____
When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth.
____

"`Get moving!`" he shouted.

== Getting Literal [[literally]]

 Want to get literal? Just prefix a line with a space (just 1 space will do).

....
I'll join that party, too.
....

We forgot to mention in <<ordered>> that you can change the numbering style.

.. first item (yeah!)
.. second item, looking `so mono`
.. third item, `mono` it is!

// This attribute line will get reattached to the next block
// despite being followed by a trailing blank line
[id='wrapup']

== Wrap-up

NOTE: AsciiDoc is quite cool, you should try it!
